run the script as simply "python query_handler.py" when envirionment is active
if the REST endpoint is in python, I could just turn it into a module and you can directly call a function "query_handler()", we'll do that later as per need

query parameters are to be written to the file "input.txt" by the REST endpoint

for group by query, the format of input is
	line 1: query type //(group/join)
	line 2: table name //(Users/Zipcodes/Movies/Ratings)
	line 3: comma separated columns list //(no trailing comma)
	line 4: FUNC(COLUMN1) //just like that in text format
	line 5: X
eg-
	group
	Users
	age, gender
	COUNT(age)
	18

for join query, format of input
	line 1: query type //(group/join)
	line 2: table 1 name //(Users/Zipcodes/Movies/Ratings)
	line 3: table 2 name //(Users/Zipcodes/Movies/Ratings)
	line 4: column name for join
	line 5: condition 2 //only simple predicate on some column, lite for now
eg-
1)	join
	Users
	Zipcodes
	zipcode
	Users.age > 18

2)	join
	Users
	Ratings
	userID
	Ratings.rating > 3

***OUTPUT***
output is stored in JSON format in <project folder path>/output/part-00000-... , the exact file name isn't important, it's just one file starting with "part".
